**How It Works**:

**File Type Mapping**: 
You define the file types (file_types) and their corresponding extensions.
**Directory to Organize**: 
Specify the directory you want to organize, such as ~/Downloads or ~/Desktop.
**Folder Creation**: 
The script creates subfolders for each file type in the specified directory.
File Movement: Files are moved into their respective folders based on their extensions. Files with unknown extensions are moved into an "Others" folder.
